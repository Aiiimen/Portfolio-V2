Every evening, I sit myself down to have my dinner in front of my computer and watch a Youtuber I'm subscribed to on Youtube. He goes by the name of Casey Neistat. The guy produces a movie about his life **every single day**. Not only that, each day he brings something new, something fresh that keeps you want to come back tomorrow for his next one. I feed off his energy and motivation! I want to produce something new everyday, I want to go to bed knowing that I've learnt something that I didn't know about before.

In the next upcoming posts I'll set myself a schedule and talk about it here. For now, I'm just going to enjoy these couple of weeks off before I start university by continuing my dailyUI and CY365 challenge and reading "Don't make me think" by Steve Krug.

*Peace*
