So on Saturday last week I was lucky enough to get a job as a videographer for a birthday party. It was a last minute thing. I only knew about it a day before. 
Having never done this type of job before my nerves were tested at the start. When I first got offered the job I could have easily said no and not stress myself about it, but I knew if I rejected it I'll regret it big time. So I went for it. Decided to dive into the unknown. 

Me, being the organised geek I am, I jumped on my computer and started researching for tips and tricks about videography. I was also offered a Canon 70D with my Canon 1200D, so I knew the gear wasn't a problem. I never used a 70D before but I wasn't worried about that. Im familiar with canon products.
At this point I had a few ideas and pictured some shots I wanted to achieve. 

I arrived a couple of hours early and straight away I whipped out the 2 cameras and started recording. I was using different lenses on different cameras, and playing around with settings. At the end, I knew I wanted two angles of everything so I setup my 1200D on my tripod with a 18mm lens and I got the 70D with a 50mm prime lens in my hand. (I'm so glad I got the 50mm lens, it's amazing! It's a must have lens). 

I ended up with 4 hours worth of footage. The editing took me around 3 hours. 
To conclude, I really enjoyed myself and learnt alot. Next time, if I ever get the chance again I know what to improve on. 

Here is a small clip I posted on my Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/BME4G_Hgofl/

Till next time! See ya!
