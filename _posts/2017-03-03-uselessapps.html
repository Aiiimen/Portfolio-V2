description: Designing useless apps is useful

Me and my friend are always discussing ideas for apps no matter how silly or how good they sound. Lately, we’ve been having a laugh over it by discussing the dumbest ideas for apps that will never sell. Hopefully you’ll see the reason why I’m dedicating time to designing these impractical apps by exampling the first design I did. 
<br>
It’s called Cuddler. Exactly like Tinder but instead of looking for a date or that special someone, you look for a potential cuddling partner. 
<br>
The design process behind this app was a little tricky because I had to do on my own. I couldn’t go and search for other similar ideas and see how they did it. So my process was to identify people’s needs when it comes to finding a partner to share your bed with. This meant I had to ask a couple of my friends and also the wonderful place we call The Internet. During this research I found out not every person likes to cuddle with another person. Some human beings like cuddling with pets, like dogs and cats. Some like to share their bed with someone in their same age group. Some like being the small spoon and some like being the big spoon. After collected all of this data about people’s preferences I managed to distil it and made it as a setting screen for people to narrow down their search. 
The next question I asked is if I’m going to share a bed with someone what do I need to know about them? Well definitely, their age, name and a photo so I’ll have an idea who I’m going to spend the night with. It’s always comforting knowing who you’re speaking to on the other side of the internet. Next question was, how do I know this person is good and I will have a good night sleep? Best way to know that is by reading what other people said. For example, 99% of people that uses amazon will read through the reviews and check the rating before purchasing the item. The same solution can be applied here.
<br>
Building these useless apps really challenges me, whether it’s the design research or designing the actual thing. One thing I struggle with as an upcoming designer is the use of typefaces and colours. 
Design is about telling a story. The layout, the colours, the typefaces… everything you see in a design contributes to telling that story. To be able to do that at a professional level you need to understand what different typefaces mean, what are the psychological effects of colours and how can a layout effect the story telling.
