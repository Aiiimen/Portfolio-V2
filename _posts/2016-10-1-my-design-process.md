Since the start of September I signed up to receive DailyUI challenges. It helps you become a better designer in just 100 days. They send daily User Interface design prompt and it’s up to me to use my creativity and come up with a solution and a design where I can share with the world and get feedback. 

With that being said, I thought I’d share my steps. How I do things from start to finish. 

**Step1: Look for inspiration** - I’ll go through my email and find out what’s the prompt for today is and give it a 5 minute thought. Try to understand what it’s asking me to find a solution for. When I’m confident with my understanding of the prompt I use the lovely thing called the interwebs and look at other’s people work and get inspiration from it.

Some of the time I find myself combining multiple designs together and adding my own touch to it. Or I find a cool little feature in one of the designs and include it in mine. 

**Step2: Crazy Eight** – This is the exciting part! I get a piece of paper and fold it in half 4 times, then unfold it, so I’ll have eight panels. Then I have 5 minutes to draw 8 sketches, one in each panel. That’s 40 seconds per sketch!! However, depending on the design, I sometimes take my time and forget about the time limit. 
Crazy Eight works really well for coming up with a lot of carried ideas or iterative ideas on an interface very quickly. 
The first 3 or 4 designs are normally common ones that I came across before and stuck in my head, so the first few panels are used to get all the common designs and ideas out of the way and use the other panels for new ideas. 

**Step3: Making it look pretty** – After all the sketches are done, I go through them all and pick my favourite (not an easy task to do). Eventually, I decide on one and go through the design again and see if there are any flaws and making any necessary changes.
I then move to Photoshop. I came across this article on Designshack.net it lists 100+ iPhone PSD and Vector mockups. I believe to sell a design to an audience; it needs to look as realistic as possible. Mockups do just that. 
I select the colors of my designs either on flatuicolors.com or coolors.co. This process is another tricky part. I can never make an easy decision. To help make it a lot easier for me I read about colors in a couple of articles and what they represent and all the psychological stuff. For example the color red is the color of power. It gets people’s attention and it holds it, which is why it’s the most popular color for marketing. 

And yeah… pretty simple. Nothing too serious. 

*Lataaaa!*
