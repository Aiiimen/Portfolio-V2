I've been reading "What they didn't teach you in design school by Phil Cleaver. In almost every page there's a saying or a quote that made me want to collect the best ones and put them in one place to go back to them and keep myself motivated.

"If the mark is not strong in black and white, it is also not going to work well - a visual identity has to work brilliant at the lowest common denominator"

"brian Grimwood used to order a bike delivery to take the finished illustration to the client, and then he had the time the bike took to get to him to finish the illustration"

"Always ask for help. You are a junior designer and if you can't crack the porblem in the allotted time, tell someone. "

"Read the brief and then re-read the brief. if you can't define the problem, you cant design the resolution to the problem. "

"Always be professional and put your all into a job even if you disagree with it. After all, it is only your point of view."

"Everything will take longer to do than you imagine. Estimating how long something takes to do and being precise about that time takes years of practice when you starting out, think of how long it should take you then double the time, and you're in with a chance."

"Your pencil and paper allow you to capture your creativity and get them down before they vanish forever"

"To design to your best advantage, you have to know the limitations of what you can and cannot do in the constantly changing web design world"

"Form follow fiction. find the story. know the story, distill the story. only then should you make visual decisions on how to tell the story. the best design begins with story"

"You need to know your target audience, understand the brief, ask the right questions, and know where and how the final product will be viewed and used. Design the solution accordingly."

"As a designer your creativity should be evident in all that you do, from the environment you live in to the clothes that you wear. you should have a curious mind, enjoy collaborations, and be prepared to take on new challenges. Your visual and social awareness should be demonstrated by the exhibitions you visit, films you watch, books you read, and the prodcuts you choose."

I enjoyed reading the book so much that I decided to design a poster/flyer to hang in my room.
