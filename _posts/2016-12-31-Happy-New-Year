<p>Another year comes to an end. for me, this year just flew by.
starting off the year with a photo challenge known as CY365 and from there I managed to improve my photography skill and also my photoshop ones too. Sadly, 9 months in, I started to fall behind due to having more important projects, like designing and developing my own portfolio which allows me to write these blog posts. shortly after that I started my summer job and from there moved to my acadamic year.

<p>my summer job and from there moved to my acadamic year.
It's my last year at university studying computer science and this year is going to burn me to the ground. In the final year you take on 3 modules and a project. This project itself has to be a big one, an advanced one. A project that will take you around 6 to 8 months to complete. Having that scale of a project to think about and 3 others modules which are code heavy and one of them is about an advanced topic. </p>

<p> nothing special happened this year. Meet new people, lose old people. Cycle of life. 

Im not a big fan of new year resolutions because I never keep them. However, my plans are to survive university for another 6 months and keep doing photography but this time im going to do the 52 week challenge. 1 photo every week. that time I'll have enough time to think about an idea and put the effort to it. 

My next plan, bigget goal, is to find an internship or lucky enough find a job that im passionate about. 

It's going to be a stressful one. The transition from a student to an adult. Im ready for it!!</p>

<p>Happy new year, Go easy 2017!</p>
