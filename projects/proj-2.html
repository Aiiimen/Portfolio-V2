<h1> Designs </h1>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> Building this website really showed me how much I enjoyed the design process.
Through out these designs I managed to discover my style, which is pretty simple. Clean and neat. Nothing too fancy or overdone.
<br>
<br>
I'm also subscribed to dailyUI where a problem is thrown at me and I have to design it.
<br>
<br>
Here are a few designs I've done.
