  <h1> Capture Your 365 </h1>

  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> I started this project on new years day where I decided to take on the challenge of capturing everyday as it goes by.
Capture your 365 is beneficial in many ways. Not only it allows me to do what I love everyday but it also makes me use my camera
on a daily basis and that helps me improve my knowledge about it and about capturing pictures in general.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to this challenge it pushed me to create pictures that I thought I could never do. It pushed my creativity to its limits and beyond.
